# [Think Like a Programmer](https://tlap.magnusjensen.dk)

## Some of the goals to achieve.

First of this is to learn about creating a full fledged web-app in React, while reading through the book. **_Think like a Programmer_**

My journey is, picking some of the challenges, and rebuilding them in react.

_Optionally: If not too hard of challenges, add some ML? to figure out the most optimal way to solve it._

## Roadmap
