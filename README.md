# [Think Like a Programmer](tlap.magnusjensen.dk)

## Some of the goals to achieve.

First of this is to learn about creating a full fledged web-app in React, while reading through the book. **_Think like a Programmer_**
My journey is, picking some of the challenges, and rebuilding them in react.

_Optionally: If not too hard of challenges, add some ML? to figure out the most optimal way to solve it._

## Roadmap

- [ ] Sliding tile game
- - [ ] Starting with a 3x3
- - [ ] Different grids that the user can choose.
- - [ ] ML/AI? Should be able to solve the puzzle the most optimal way.
